Jaihyun Park is an Assistant Professor of Library and Information Science at Indiana University Indianapolis (IUI). 

Emphasizing the social aspect of information, his research interests intersect in (1) Digital Humanities, (2) Computational Social Science, and (3) Data Curation under the broad umbrella of the Information Science discipline. Methodologically driven by computational approaches such as text mining, natural language processing, and network analysis, Park is interested in understanding how ideologically opposing groups employ language to construct their unique discourse communities and establish networks. Park leverages a diverse array of textual data, ranging from digitized historical newspapers to contemporary social media, collected from multiple platforms to examine how textual information reflects the dynamics of a divided society. Park’s project focused on studying the coverage of Asian workers in the U.S. historical newspapers to explore how semantic distance differs across each State, how then-Confederate and then-Union States used the words differently, and what stories were reprinted. This Digital Humanities project was presented at the NLP4DH conference. Park’s project on Computational Social Science examined how Trump supporters, especially those who migrated from Twitter (now X) to Parler during the Presidential Election created different discourses and formed a distinct network structure. This project appeared in the Journal of Information Science. In the recent Data Curation research project, Park claimed that the established research data lifecycle should be revisited to adopt newly emerging machine learning datasets. Park emphasized that reusing machine learning datasets can introduce social bias and stereotypes without informing researchers and users of AI systems. This project appeared in the Journal of Information Science. Park obtained his Ph.D. degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, MLIS degree and CAS in Data Science from Syracuse University and his BA from Yonsei University. Prior to Indiana University Indianapolis, Park was an assistant professor at Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
